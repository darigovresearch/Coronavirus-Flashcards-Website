# Coronavirus-Flashcards-Website
Website for https://github.com/darigovresearch/Corona-Virus-Flashcards

The website can be viewed here https://darigovresearch.github.io/Coronavirus-Flashcards-Website/

## Introduction

### What is it?
A centralised location to find key educational tool to learn about topics not just to do with this Pandemic but also future outbreaks.

It will be primarily put into a form which can be easily learnt/revised using Anki a cross platform app specifically designed for long term knowledge retention. The website is so that it is easily viewable and portable to any form. We hope to make the dataset in such a reusable format that any people who wish to use the content in their own application need to only point to the centralised location. This will help with providing updates directly instead of just a static website.

This will be a community driven project to ensure most accurate information and that corrections can be easily provided. We hope to translate this into as many languages as possible to make it as accessible as possible to a wider variety of people.

### Who is it for?
- General public
  - To help people learn about the topic during this epidemic & so that knowledge is retained to prevent lessons being forgotten in the future
- Teachers
  - Can be used in a course curriculum for students
- Developers
  - Many applications to do with the outbreak will need to so we hope to make the data easily integratable into an in-app FAQ or so it can be used during a loading screen for example
- Students
  - To learn about the various topics that this situation presents

Flashcard content is published under suitable open source licenses so that they can be improved and built upon and so that people do not need to reinvent the wheel when trying to learn or teach about these topics.

### Initial content
Content will be broken down initially into the following sections (but we are open to additional suggestions)

1. Glossary of terms
2. History of epidemics
3. Biology
4. Medicine
5. Mathematics
6. Manufacturing & Logistics
7. Public Policy
8. Sociology
9. Academia
10. Appendix - Flashcards FAQ
11. Appendix - Coronavirus FAQ
12. Appendix - Corrections

### What Help will we need?
- Content writers
  - Need people to write the content for the relevant sections of the flashcards
- Content checkers
  - People to test & verify that the content is correct
- Web developers
  - Will probably need html, css, python developers to build the website and to automate the pulling of the data from GitHub
- Translators
  - We hope to make the content easily understandable in any language as pandemics are global issues
- Sharers
  - Getting the word out on the project will help encourage people to use the resources and to potentially contribute as well

## Contributing
To make this project extensible as far into the future as possible we are following certain rules which will also make it possible to programmatically pull the data.

Pull requests, corrections, translations & fixes are welcome. Any contributions must be submitted under the same license that the original piece of work (see below). Take a look at any open issues or submit new ones if there is something that needs to be fixed or added.
